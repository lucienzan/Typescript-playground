## Note
1 - If you have installed TypeScript locally and want to check the output, you can use this command:

```bash
npx tsc example.ts
```

2 - If you have installed globally, you can use like this
```bash
tsc example.ts
```
or
```bash
node example.js
```

## Used By

In this playground, I have installed TypeScript locally, so you can use it as the first option. Thank you.
